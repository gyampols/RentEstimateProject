 A website that offers online tools to connect home-buyers with mortgage lenders has done a split test on different call to action button copies and placements.  The goal of this project was two-fold.  1. predict the probability of a user clicking the call to action button. 2. Determine the ideal copy and placement combination to maximize revenue.
